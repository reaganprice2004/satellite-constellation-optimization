# ðŸš€ Satellite Constellation Optimization Project
**1. Define the problem**
* **Goal:** Optimize the number and orbital configuration of satellites to maximize Earth coverage while minimizing cost!
* **Inputs:**
*   Number of satellites
*   Orbital altitude
*   Inclination
*   Cost per satellite
* **Outputs:**
*   Coverage percentage (how much of Earth is covered at all times)
*   Total cost
*   Trade-off curve (coverage vs. cost)
